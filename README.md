# World_Weather_Analysis

 The purpose of this project is to improve the popular PlanMyTrip app by adding the weather description to the weather data. Then, the developers will have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, the developers will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
